The following Project was written in order that I would be able to efficiently copy and paste spreadsheets in Excel, and so that they can be easily saved to a PDF. This was a work related task,
and was meant to make the process of timesheet reporting more efficient for one of the contracts I was assigned to work on. The two files are basic files:

- copyPaste.bas - copy and pastes one form in Excel to another form, and iterates the worksheet names, dates, and any other values accordingly. Ideally it would also pull from a central database 
                  of time information, however my company does not have such a database.
- saveAsPDF.bas - saves all the files in a given workbook to an appropriate folder categorized by month. These files are then used in the submission of requests for contract payments, and are
                  categorized by month to allow for efficient use of time
